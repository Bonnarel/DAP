# SIA

The Simple Image Access protocol (SIA) provides capabilities for the discovery, description, 
access, and retrieval of multi-dimensional image datasets, including 2-D images as well as 
datacubes of three or more dimensions.  

## Status

The last stable version is
**[REC-2.0](https://ivoa.net/documents/SIA/20151223/)**.

SIA 2.0 ported to github

* SIA 2.0 became an IVOA recommendation on december the 23rd 2015
* Original source was an OpenOffice file 
* Here can be found the result of porting this specification to GitHub
* Some changes in lay out of the document
    * "Status of the document" section is automatically generated by ivoatex process
    * Tables have a different rendering than in the original version
    * References are using the "\citep" flavor. They are generally quoted only once, with a few exceptions when it is ambiguous. Original version used the "[n]" notation for each occurence of the publication to be quoted in the text.
    * This porting has been made to allow authors to propose PR for identified errata and propose changes towards version 2.1
